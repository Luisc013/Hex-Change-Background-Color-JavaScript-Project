# Hex-Change-Background-Color-JavaScript-Project
Project Objectives
This HEX background color changing app was also short and sweet to complete.

However, I did find the instructor's solution interesting.

The idea was to make a random hex value created from an array of all the possible different hex values, loop through them, and concatenate 6 different values to a String that begun with the # character.

In other words, once the HEX value string is created, you'd simply change the background color to that value just like in the change background color project.
